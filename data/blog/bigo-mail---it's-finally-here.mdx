* **Be who you are** and have fun on camera - your personality is what makes you unique and attractive to your fans.

* **Be professional** and remember that you're representing yourself and your brand when you go live. People come to Bigo Live for the experience, and it's up to all of us to make sure we are using our platform to deliver on this expectation.

* **Be consistent** with your broadcasts - your fans will appreciate it if they can count on you to show up and entertain them at the same time every day.

* **Engage with your fans** - the more you interact with your fans, the more they will enjoy watching your broadcasts and the more likely they are to keep coming back. Asking them questions, getting to know them, and giving them shoutouts are a few great ways to build your brand.
